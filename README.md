# A-Star-Search-Algorithm
<html>
This project is the implementation of the A* Search Algorithm in Java</br>
This Project:</br>
            &emsp; Creates a 15x15 environment (225 nodes) for the agent to conduct its search to find the shortest path to the goal.</br>
            &emsp; Randomly chooses 10% of the nodes to mark as inaccessible.</br>
            &emsp; Utilizes the A* Search Algorithm and uses the Manhattan Distance as its heuristic function. </br>
            &emsp; Displays the search in the termninal and also creates a GUI for the user for a better viewing experience</br>
